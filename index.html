      <p>
         I am a **Master's student in Computer Science** at William Jessup University, with a focus on **full-stack development** and **data analysis**. Through both academic coursework and hands-on projects, I have developed a strong foundation in a variety of technologies, including **React**, **Python**, **Django**, **Java**, and **SQL/NoSQL** databases. My technical skills are complemented by my ability to tackle complex problems, collaborate effectively with teams, and manage time efficiently.
        </p>
       <p>
         One of my most exciting projects includes a <span> Full-Stack E-Commerce Application</span>, where I developed an end-to-end platform using<span> React </span>  for the front end and <span>Node.js</span> for the back end. I implemented features such as <span>user authentication</span>, <span>product management</span>, and a **shopping cart** to provide a seamless user experience. I’ve also applied machine learning techniques to create a **Predictive Model** for housing price analysis and built a **Real-Time Event Detection System** using deep learning to improve security monitoring in CCTV-surveilled areas.</p>
         <p>
         In addition to my academic and technical accomplishments, I gained valuable professional experience as an **Associate in the Production Department** at Infinitum Network Solutions, where I worked with cross-functional teams to develop digital media solutions and troubleshoot technical issues. My exposure to **web technologies** and **multimedia production** further honed my problem-solving and technical skills.</p>
        <p>
         I am continuously expanding my knowledge through certifications, including **Python Programming** and **Certified Web Developer (CIW)**, and I am committed to leveraging my skills to develop impactful software solutions. With a passion for coding, problem-solving, and innovation, I am eager to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of technology and create real-world impact.
